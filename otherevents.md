Certainly! In addition to the 'click' event, there are many other types of events that you can listen for and handle in JavaScript DOM manipulation. Here are some commonly used events:

1. **Mouse Events**:
   - `mouseenter`: Triggered when the mouse pointer enters an element.
   - `mouseleave`: Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
   - `mousemove`: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
   - `mousedown`: Triggered when a mouse button is pressed over an element.
   - `mouseup`: Triggered when a mouse button is released over an element.
   - `mouseover`: Similar to `mouseenter`, but it bubbles up through the DOM tree.

2. **Keyboard Events**:
   - `keydown`: Triggered when a key is pressed.
   - `keyup`: Triggered when a key is released.
   - `keypress`: Triggered when a key that produces a character value is pressed.

3. **Form Events**:
   - `submit`: Triggered when a form is submitted.
   - `reset`: Triggered when a form is reset.
   - `input`: Triggered when the value of an input element changes (not supported in IE9 and earlier).
   - `change`: Triggered when the value of a form element changes and loses focus.
   - `focus`: Triggered when an element receives focus.
   - `blur`: Triggered when an element loses focus.

4. **Window Events**:
   - `load`: Triggered when the page and all its resources (images, stylesheets, etc.) have finished loading.
   - `unload`: Triggered when the user navigates away from the page.
   - `resize`: Triggered when the browser window is resized.
   - `scroll`: Triggered when the user scrolls the page.

5. **Touch Events**:
   - `touchstart`: Triggered when a finger touches the screen.
   - `touchend`: Triggered when a finger is lifted off the screen.
   - `touchmove`: Triggered when a finger moves across the screen.

6. **Drag and Drop Events**:
   - `dragstart`: Triggered when a draggable element starts to be dragged.
   - `dragend`: Triggered when a drag operation is completed.
   - `dragenter`: Triggered when a dragged element enters a drop target.
   - `dragleave`: Triggered when a dragged element leaves a drop target.
   - `dragover`: Triggered when a dragged element is being dragged over a drop target.
   - `drop`: Triggered when a dragged element is dropped on a drop target.

These are just a few examples of the many events available in the DOM. Understanding and utilizing these events can greatly enhance the interactivity and user experience of your web applications.
